# Multilingual-Sentiment-Classification
Fine-tuning a multilingual transformer model for binary sentiment classification using Huggingface Transformers and PyTorch.


## Project Overview
- Fine-tune a pre-trained multilingual transformer model for sentiment analysis (positive/negative).
- Training and validation data are provided in CSV format.
- Evaluation is done using macro F1 score.
- The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts.
- Local saving and loading of model and tokenizer without relying on Huggingface Hub.


## Pretrained Model

The pretrained model and tokenizer are hosted on Huggingface Hub:
